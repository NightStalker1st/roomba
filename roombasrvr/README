Below is the uvccapture readme.

You need to install jpeglib.h and maybe other things it depends on (like maybe
the whole linux include directory). 

to build the configure file for roombasrvr for the Fon router:
run ./configure --host mips-linux-uclibc --build i586-linux-pc-gnu

or for Chumby:
./configure --host arm-none-linux-gnueabi --build i586-linux-pc-gnu

Make sure $PATH has /usr/arm-linux/bin
(because gnu cross-compiler depends on finding arm-none-linux-gnuabi-gcc)

To make it, just run Make or Make clean
Then copy it down to the router or Chumby

Run ser.sh before starting this program (the client relies on it - FIXME)
Run it with something like:
# ./roombasrvr -v -d/dev/video0 -m -t0 -x160 -y120

Next, start Bsquare with the following arguments:
-p 192.168.15.240:5002 -c getVideo -X -v 100 -d 100
(change port as needed)
Stretch the video window

===================================================
uvccapture: USB UVC Video Class Snapshot Software
Newest versions always available at http://staticwave.ca/source/uvccapture

This software is based of the package luvcview:
Copyright (C) 2005 2006 Laurent Pinchart &&  Michel Xhaard

Modifications and updates:
Copyright (C) 2006  Gabriel A. Devenyi <ace@staticwave.ca>

This program communicates via the USB UVC Video Class driver for V4L2, available
at http://linux-uvc.berlios.de/.

The purpose of this software is to capture an image from a USB webcam at a
specified interval, and save it to a JPEG file, no other formats are supported,
imagemagick can handle anything else you might need.

Right now this software is really a hack, since still image support is not yet
available in the UVC driver. The program continually polls the UVC driver in
MJPEG mode, and at a specified interval writes a JPEG header and a single frame
to file, creating a JPEG image. Because of this continuous polling, this program
has high CPU usage. Input checking is pretty trusting, so call it with the right
parameters.

In order for this software to work, whatever device you pass to -d you will need
to have read/write rights to, please see appropriate /dev documentation for how
to do this.

This software depends on jpeglib(present on almost all systems)

For usage information, run uvccapture -h
