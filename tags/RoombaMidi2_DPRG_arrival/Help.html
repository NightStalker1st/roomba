<h1> RoombaMidi2 Help </h1>
 
Make the Roomba a musical instrument!
<br><br>
RoombaMidi2 appears as a MIDI destination called 'RoombaMidi2 In' <br>
to MIDI apps like Ableton Live, Apple Logic or any other sequencer.<br>
<br>
The right-hand side lets you select which Roomba to connect to a MIDI channel.<br>
Pick the serial port that corresponds to your Roomba and click the connect button.<br>
If successful, the Roomba will emit a small beep.<br>
<br>
The left-hand side lets you control the currently selected Roomba. <br>
A Roomba is assigned to a single MIDI channel.  <br>
<br>
Connect up a Roomba, use test buttons, send it MIDI!<br>
<br>
